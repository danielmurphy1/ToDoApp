# Vanilla JavaScript Web ToDo App

_Simple Web Based ToDo App Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_

## Instructions

---

Add items to your list by entering them in the text box and clicking the button. Mark an item as complete by selecting the check box. Once an item is marked as complete, it can be deleted by clicking the delete button.

Don't have time to finish all of your list now? Your list will reload when you revist the app or reload the page using local storage!

### Summary

I created this app to learn about DOM manipulation and how to use local storage in the browser. The app allows the user to input items to add to their list, adds and removes them from an array, and saves them to local storage for later use.

It took me approxiamtely 17 hours to learn the skills needed for this app, write the code, and to debug. I learned a lot about manipulating and traversing the DOM and how to set and retrieve data to and from local browser storage. It was fun to solve the problems that I ran into while developing this app.

Update: I have revistited this application approximately 3 months after first writing it for editing and refactoring. The structure of the application remains the same; however, much of the code has been refactored to make the code more readable and to put code that was reused into reusable functions. In essence, I have taken what I have learned in the last few months and applied it to this earlier project. Enjoy comparing the old code to the new!
